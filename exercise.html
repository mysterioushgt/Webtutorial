    <p class="b">mountain, landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally 
    exhibiting steep slopes, a relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief.Mountains 
    generally are understood to be larger than hills, but the term has no standardized geological
    meaning.Hawaii is at the top of a volcanic mountain in the Pacific Ocean. More than half 
    the mountain is below water. The largest range of mountains is in the Alantic Ocean.
     Mountains cover one-fifth of the earth's land surface, and occur in 75 percent of the 
     world's countries.</p>
